# yieldmo_mergeContacts
I have put together here a Python code to merge a list of contacts by phone or email. Given a list of contacts, where each contact is of type class `contact` with propeties 'name', 'phone' and 'email'.  The code will merge the contacts by phone or email (similar to feature you have in phones).

`Given

[{Name:'Mr. X', phone:'123-456-7890', email: 'x@yieldmo.com'},

{Name:'Ms. Y', phone:'456-789-1234', email: 'y@yieldmo.com'},

{Name:'Mr. X1', phone:'123-456-7890', email: 'x@gmail.com'},

{Name:'Ms. Y1', phone:'456-789-9999', email: 'y@yieldmo.com'}]

Return:

[ [{Name:'Mr. X', phone:'123-456-7890', email: 'x@yieldmo.com'},{Name:'Mr. X1', phone:'123-456-7890', email: 'x@gmail.com'}],

[{Name:'Ms. Y', phone:'456-789-1234', email: 'y@yieldmo.com'},{Name:'Ms. Y1', phone:'456-789-9999', email: 'y@yieldmo.com'}] ]`
